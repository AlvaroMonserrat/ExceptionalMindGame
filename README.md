# ExceptionalMindGame (under construction)
In this community we create artistic images and connect them to the TEXT of 94 questions and answers of a philosophical game and its book of answers to produce videos for YouTube (and other things). The TEXT of the questions and answers are Charles Kocian copyright © creations. This TEXT is the “licensed material” under the CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. Any arts can be created in the videos, such as background images, animations or similar to support the TEXT of the 94 questions and answers, but the TEXT itself cannot be changed. We invite contributors to create their own video version for a question and answer. The TEXT of the 94 questions and answers (and the template) is in the "main" branch of the repository. Fork it and create your own version of a video for YouTube. Discover more and how to do it in the King Neo New Renaissance Movement website link.
