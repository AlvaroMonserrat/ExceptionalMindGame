# ExceptionalMindGame (under construction)
In this community we create artistic images and connect them to the TEXT of 94 questions and answers of a philosophical game and its book of answers to produce videos for YouTube (and other things). The TEXT of the questions and answers are Charles Kocian copyright © creations. This TEXT is the “licensed material” under the CREATIVE COMMONS ATTRIBUTION-NODERIVATIVES 4.0 INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC LICENSE. Any arts can be created in the videos, as background or similar to support the TEXT of the 94 questions and answers, but the TEXT itself cannot be changed. Create your video version using the same TEXT for a question and answer. The TEXT of the 94 questions and answers and the story-board-template is the "main" branch data of the repository. Anyone can fork the story-board-template and choose a question/answer to create its own version of an artistic video for YouTube. Discover more and how to do it in the website link.
